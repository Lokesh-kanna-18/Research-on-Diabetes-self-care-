We took a survey from social media to collect data of Diabetes patients, processed the data and analyzed on SPSS software

INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a prevalent disease that affects a large number of people worldwide. According to the 
World Health Organization, approximately 422 million people were living with diabetes in 2014, 
and this number is projected to increase to 629 million by 2045. This highlights the importance of 
raising awareness about the disease, as it affects a significant portion of the population. Selfassessment of an individual remotely reduces the need for in-person follow-up visits and provides 
a more immediate and accurate picture of their blood sugar levels and overall health. The objective 
of diabetes self-management is to help individuals with diabetes maintain good blood sugar control 
and to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes-related complications. This typically involves 
monitoring blood sugar levels, taking medication as prescribed, healthy eating, regular physical 
activity, managing stress, and regular visits to a healthcare provider for check-ups. The ultimate 
goal is to improve the individual's overall quality of life and to reduce the risk of developing serious 
health problems as a result of diabetes. 



PROPOSED METHODOLOGY

• This project aims to evaluate the level of awareness and understanding among individuals 
with diabetes about their condition with the help of the survey conducted.
• The survey consists of responses over various categories of diabetic individuals. So the 
study proceeds with predictive analysis on the awareness and self-care of different patients 
from different category. 
• In the context of patient awareness, predictive analysis could be used to identify patients 
who are at risk of not being aware of their condition or treatment, and to develop strategies 
to increase their awareness. 
• This type of analysis can be useful for identifying patients who may need additional 
education or support, and for evaluating the effectiveness of different interventions for 
increasing awareness.
• Once patients with low awareness of diabetes have been identified, they are prescribed with 
self-care plans that include regular physical activity, healthy eating, monitoring blood sugar 
levels, taking medication as prescribed, and getting regular check-ups with a healthcare 
provider, tailored to individual needs and preferences.
